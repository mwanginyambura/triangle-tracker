\#What is Triangle TRACKER
This is an application in identifying a particular triangle based on its value dimensions.

A triangle has three dimensions which are length,width and height.

So in out code we will have three values based on these dimensions.

We will differentiation these triangles based on its properties.

There are four different types of triangles.
Which are scalene, isosceles, equilateral and non-triangle.

so in our code snipped based on the JavaScript side, there is logic based on differentiating the triangles.

scalene - all sides are unequal
isosceles  two sides side are equal
equilateral - all sides are equal
non-triangle - not a triangle

In our code we will have input fields based on length, width ad height so as to identify these triangles.
